        <p id="two">Web Developing module , came this semester as one of the most complex parts for this academic year . Both , design and code implementation experience from this semester , contributed for creating five web pages that contain basic Html and CSS elements that are displayed on this project .
        </p>
        <p id="three">The first touch with Html and CSS this semester was in the first week when I really enjoyed the lectures and start to coding in this new area of Html and CSS. The lab sessions from the first week was really comfortable to complete . After I finish them , I go on the internet to watch more content about this new area of study that I get into . After hours of youtube people talking about what is web development area and how it work on the industry , I go to the Udemy website . Here I found a very large amount of people teaching both , free and cost courses about different programming languages . I put in my library courses about basics In Java , SQL , C++ and CSS . Regarding them , I code by myself a Timer , Dice game and a Website . </p>
        <p id="four">The next lectures was coming with more amazing information that I was completely ready to go into it . In the Topic three we start doing websites that allows the user to put them into mobile format which is making a big difference on what we do before . The mobile formats are under 1000px wide compared to desktop that is more than 1000px wide , the html file requesting  more specifications on the code , so the program will know if your website will be acceptable for only for mobile , desktop or both . Regarding the Nested hover , I learn how to create really nice menus with sub menus on each items from it . In this part of the semester I create a webpage that was destinated for car lovers . I create a main page with a menu , and the menu was containing 10 brand of cars . Each time the user was clicking on a specific type of car , he was redirected to a page that contain 5 images with that car brand .   </p>
        <p id="five">The CSS code is my favourite from this year because is focusing  most of the part on the design and aesthetic side of the webpage . I practice some different designs for my webpages this semester . One of them it can be found on my second page , around the placeholder images . The function used is called “ box shadow “ and it will make the item to look more radiant with light . I practice with that on borders or columns and rows . The next design that I find it interesting is the mirror effect . As it can be observed in the Contact page , I create a circle in the right-top of the page , I set a background image for the circle that is the simple user icon and under that it displays a mirror effect . That visual element is generated by the attribute “ webkit-box-reflect” .</p>
